JEDI ACADEMY IRC

PLEASE READ THIS! IT WILL ANSWER A LOT OF YOUR QUESTIONS!

----------------
INTRODUCTION
----------------

IRC is one of the oldest protocols in existence.
JA is one of the older games out there.

Combine.
Profit?


The result is this, Jedi Academy IRC. 
For most players, this handy tool may unfortunately cause the downfall of the game ("it's a chatroom not a game, hurr"). I realize that. But the implications of this far reach the general masses. I wrote this in my spare time, with hope that this would make things easier for Jedi Knight Galaxies. But also, it could be used as a general global chat for all players.

By default, it is set up to connect to the irc.arloria.net server. I am on good terms with the server admin (Sheep), so if you see him, tell him I said Hi (:D)

-----------------
FEATURES
-----------------

- Chat with any player, on any server, regardless if playing in Jedi Academy or not.
- Built into the game, no alt-tabbing, no shift-tabbing, no scroll-lock-x-ing. All handled through the console.
- Lightweight, zero impact on FPS
- Works with most serverside mods (Lugormod, JA+ (if you don't have the plugin), OJP (if you don't have the plugin), Makermod, and of course, baseJA)
- Open Source. Implement into your own code project.
